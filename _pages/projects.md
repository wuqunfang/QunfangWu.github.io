I see myself as a technological activist researcher, dedicated to empowering marginalized populations by including their voices in the understanding, critique, design, and development of equitable technologies. my work has examined harms such as online racist discourses and governance, while documenting diverse forms and scales of resistance, ranging from individual to institutional levels. My work contributes to epistemic resistance, providing knowledge and design principles that inform how resistance can be adapted across various contexts for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers.
