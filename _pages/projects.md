I see myself as a technological activist researcher, dedicated to empowering marginalized populations by including their voices in the understanding, critique, and design of equitable technologies. 

Methodologically, I employ both qualitative (e.g., interview, ethnography, critical discourse analysis) and quantitative methods (e.g., survey, regression, topic modeling) to understand user behaviors across challenging contexts such as public safety, online racist discourses, and deceptive design in livestreaming. I also incorporate system design methods and principles from HCI to further inform my work. 

My research engages with critical studies and theories, such as new racism, intersectionality, feminism, and design justice. I use these frameworks as productive lenses for unpacking power dynamics and preventing the perpetuation of power imbalances in research activities.

### Countering “Platformed Racism” in Online Communities

My dissertation work unpacked how Reddit users engaged in discourse frames that both re-enforce and fight against racism, and the interactions and moderation on Reddit were deeply mediated by and through overt and covert racist ideologies.

### Designing for Individual and Institutional Algorithmic Resistance

My research documents diverse forms and scales of resistance, ranging from individual to institutional levels. These works contribute to epistemic resistance, including empirical knowledge and design principles, that inform how resistance can be designed and adapted to more socio-technical systems.

### Supporting End-User Algorithm Audits

Our team has developed an intervention tool, MapMyFeed, to assist everyday users in navigating the auditing process. The tool offers educational resources to help users understand the mechanics of algorithmic recommendations and enables them to identify and report problematic or biased algorithmic behaviors. Users’ proactive involvement fosters algorithmic literacy and transparency and more equitable digital environments.
